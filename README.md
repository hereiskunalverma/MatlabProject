# Matlab First Semester Project

Recently I attended a workshop on Matlab where I am introduced to various applications of matlab in real life, which includes data processing, data transmission, machine learning, and much more.

Based on it I decided to do a simple and basic project which to just highlight my skill on matlab that I have learned in my first semester.

So I made an project on "Automatic Certificate Generator".


- This is just a basic implementation of what a lot of organizations and institutes, and companies used to generate online certificates.


# Note -I whole heartedly welcome modifications and suggestions.
